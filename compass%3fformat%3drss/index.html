<h2><strong>The United Nations</strong></h2><p class="">Before we dive into Model United Nations, it is important that you understand the actual United Nations. Commonly abbreviated as the UN, the United Nations was founded in 1945 in the aftermath of the Second World War. An intergovernmental organisation succeeding the previous League of Nations, the UN was created with the primary purpose of maintaining international peace and security. Nowadays, the UN is also heavily involved with maintaining the global ecosystem surrounding human rights, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. Programs such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as numerous other initiatives are clear examples of their mission in action.</p><p class="">Much of the UN’s substantive work is accomplished through events called conferences. During these events, ambassadors representing nations from all around the world congregate to resolve issues of various scales, ranging from international nuclear disarmament and resolving regional conflicts to combating global warming and ending poverty. These conferences can last up to seven days, and, along with their various subcommittees meeting year-round, the UN is able to provide the world with a safe and effective platform for dialogue and, ultimately, change.</p><p class="">It is important to note that the UN is not where national laws are created. Its decisions cannot be enforced on member states as the respect of sovereignty is established within the UN charter; domestic constitutions overpower these resolutions.</p>&nbsp;<h2><strong>Model United Nations</strong></h2><p class="">With a considerable number of participants from all over the world, Model United Nations (MUN) is amongst the most well-known activities for high school students and young adults. In MUN, participants — also called delegates — assume the job of ambassadors who speak on behalf of one of the 193 Member States of the United Nations. Since delegates are assigned to represent a specific country, they do not advocate for their  own convictions on the topic at hand; rather, they abide to their nation’s stance during the conference and attempt to mimic the actions their country would take when debating topics.</p><p class="">Partaking in MUN will enable delegates to garner significant debating abilities such as public-speaking, teamwork, and leadership with real-world applications. MUN also grants delegates the chance to interact with individuals from various nations and cultures, thus, expanding their common point of view. Schools and colleges realise that Model United Nations trains these aptitudes, so cooperation in MUN can likewise be a foundation of a formidable university application, particularly for those who attain executive positions in conferences and school clubs.</p>&nbsp;<h2><strong>What to Expect at a Traditional MUN Conference</strong></h2><p class="">With the multitude of MUN conferences being held worldwide, there are a myriad of distinct styles and qualities that every conference possess as well as a number of unique variations that make each one one of a kind. At NorthMUN, we are centred around the notion of fostering the spirit of the UN, striving to be as realistic as possible in order to provide delegates with a fulfilling, substantial, and affordable experience. </p><p class="">Many key components of MUN, however, remain consistent throughout all conferences and are highly dependent on the delegates. First, a delegate should always read his/her committee background guide thoroughly to understand the stance of the country he/she represents. Upon the reading of the backgrounder and conducting further research, delegates should also submit a position paper which details an overview of the topic(s), his/her position, and potential solutions.</p><p class="">Throughout the conference, delegates must always stay sharp and be prepared to think spontaneously. There will be a wide range of topics that will be explored; thus, you must be prepared to present your stance at all times. Towards the end of the day, delegates must come together to agree on a concluding idea and draft a resolution paper. The resolution paper is the key to the end of a successful conference as it includes the final proposal of the committee as a whole after compromising. Awards for each committee, specifically Best Delegate, Outstanding Delegate, Honourable Mention(s), Best Researched Delegate, and Best New Delegate, are presented at the end of the conference. Keep in mind the number of awards is subject to change based on the size of the committee. In the end, however, this conference will gift you only what you put into it. If you actively involve yourself in the debate and come prepared, your dais will notice, and you will reap the benefits of your efforts.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>&nbsp;]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbbf8447788970669bcc370/1566016647074-WM31L8JB2PAEJU3HWU1B/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">What is Model United Nations?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Choosing the Most Suitable Committee</title><dc:creator>Chief of Staff</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.northmun.com/compass/choosing-the-right-committee</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bbbf8447788970669bcc370:5d57750dbb302e00014ab9ac:5d578757b04c870001eb3f6f</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<h2><strong>The Onus of Choice - A Guide to Selecting Committees</strong></h2><p class="">As you are introduced to the committees at NorthMUN 2021 for the first time, you may hesitate on what to choose. If you are a first-time delegate, your first instinct may be to choose a General Assembly that seems the least imposing. If you have some experience, the preference may be a committee you have already delegated in. What unites both these emotion-driven responses is a fear of making wrong choices, and one, in extreme cases, coined by Princeton University philosopher Walter Kaufmann: decidophobia. </p><p class="">Let’s take a step back. What is the purpose of MUN? To me, it is a platform to upgrade my communication skillset, absorbing new skills and refining pre-existing ones. No matter my future profession or current passions, these skills, notably those of debate, negotiation, and rhetoric, may be altered and applied in any circumstance. Thus, we at NorthMUN have sought to foster a welcoming environment in each of our committees for all delegates to experiment.</p><p class="">More practically, choosing a committee first involves determining your areas of interest. You may particularly enjoy economics, political dynamics, or health systems. Perhaps, contemporary issues are not your dish, and historical scenarios are your preference. Mayhap, you are looking for a committee that aids you in enhancing your adaptation abilities more than research skills.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Luckily, NorthMUN 2021 has created a committees program that offers all of these experiences. Nonetheless, having topics that interest you does not automatically imply that you will do well. Your success will depend on the effort you put in; spending an hour writing a position paper can make all the difference between ‘standing aloof in giant ignorance’ and leading debate. Under our committees page, I strongly recommend you to browse through each of our topic overviews and  committee descriptions to get a better grasp of whether or not a certain committee fits your tastes. However, we also encourage you to explore new fields and venture beyond your comfort zone. In line with the mere-exposure effect, your interest in a particular field is a function of time and experience, so do not bar yourself from endless possibilities. </p><p class="">Lastly, please use the background guides written by your respective Directors to your greatest advantage as they will serve as the initiating force of your own research. Should any questions regarding our topics or its selection process arise, please do not hesitate email me at <a href="mailto:cos@northmun.com">cos@northmun.com</a>. I wish you all the best in your preparations and look forward to meeting you virtually!</p>&nbsp;]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbbf8447788970669bcc370/1566017454785-W3PU37GCL2QPTWKH4PTV/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Choosing the Most Suitable Committee</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Practicing for a Conference</title><dc:creator>USG of Committees</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.northmun.com/compass/2019/9/30/practicing-for-a-conference-mock-sessions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bbbf8447788970669bcc370:5d57750dbb302e00014ab9ac:5d92c9e953425916d16fdf92</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<h2><strong>The Drive Behind Success - Mock Sessions</strong></h2><p class="">Model United Nations is highly favoured and accessible by many students and schools in Vancouver. In order to support students’ growth in Model UN, many schools provide extensive programs for students to get familiar with, learn about and try out this fascinating type of debate. By educating students about current global issues, how to analyse a topic through various aspects and the formality of committee sessions, students can be well-prepared and know what to do at their first MUN conference. However, Model UN clubs at school do not only offer direct education and knowledge, but also a very essential aspect — Mock Model United Nations sessions.</p><p class="">Since a MUN committee contains various tasks and procedures, it definitely requires understanding and experience. This creates a scenario where beginner delegates are extremely confused about what is happening during committee sessions. Therefore, by adding in a mock Model United Nations session at school, delegates can be able to get a glimpse at how committees are going to run before being in an actual conference. The structure of a mock MUN session is similar with a committee session, except for the fact that teachers or student leaders will constantly be guiding delegates throughout and assisting delegates to familiarise the rules of procedure of MUN. This does not only offer more experience to students but also enhance their confidence to speak up when debating in a committee. It is believed that these mock MUN sessions can also lead to further education: Teachers or student leaders tend to spark discussion by brainstorming and mind-mapping the topic with students before starting the session, encouraging students to gain more global knowledge and learn how to look at topics in different perspectives and ideas. What if you are already experienced? Mock MUN sessions can be able to track your progress, such as your fluency in speeches and how often you contribute to the committee.</p><p class="">NorthMUN 2021 views the importance of what schools can contribute to each delegate’s Model United Nations development and we believe that school clubs can definitely reflect delegates’ Model UN career. As an active member of the MUN community, I have come across some delegates who were unfortunate to lack a decent MUN club at school. Therefore, I highly encourage these delegates to take the initiative to start a club and experience the benefits of mock MUN sessions to themselves as well as their fellow classmates. If you have inquiries about school MUN clubs and mock sessions, please do not hesitate to contact me, the USG of Committees at <a href="mailto:committees@northmun.com"><span>committees@northmun.com</span></a>.</p>&nbsp;]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbbf8447788970669bcc370/1569901851333-TSIJEU2Z8YVHC2HYF2LJ/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Practicing for a Conference</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Committees in Model UN</title><dc:creator>USG of Committees</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.northmun.com/compass/committees-in-mun</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bbbf8447788970669bcc370:5d57750dbb302e00014ab9ac:5dee0b87ce1e084cec99e8a2</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;<h2><strong>Understanding Committees</strong></h2><p class="">Nowadays, Model United Nations conferences are found everywhere, run by anyone,  from students and clubs to organisations and institutions from all around the world. Each conference has its own unique name, goals, and vision, but oftentimes conferences will share a number of similar or same committees. Generally, there are four main types of committees: General Assemblies/Beginner Committees, Intermediate/Specialised Committees, Regional Councils and Advanced Committees. Although each type consists of more than only a few committees, there is definitely a possibility that some committees will be seen more often than once, especially in regards to General Assemblies. Each committee type oversees a distinct purpose, structure and format, as well as cater towards an audience of a certain experience range. In this article I will be discussing the intricacies and commonalities among each of these types.</p>&nbsp;<hr />&nbsp;<h3><strong>General Assemblies/Beginner Committees</strong></h3>

<p class="">General Assemblies are the most comprehensive subunits of the United Nations. Novice Delegates are often drawn to these on the grounds of their size and large-scale nature of the topics and problems faced. The term General Assembly is often synonymous with ‘beginner committees’, and conferences will oftentimes utilise both terms. Technically, the General Assembly title should only apply to committees within the GA plenary itself, such as the First Committee (DISEC), the Second Committee (SOCHUM), and so on. However, it’s attribution to these entry-level committees has made it an umbrella term for other non-GA committees, with the most common being the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p><p class="">In reality, these committees are suited for both novice and experienced Delegates alike, and the topics can range from political and economic affairs to social problems. Research and information for these committees are easily accessible and can often be found online or at a local library, with prime sources being past UN resolutions, as well as reports published by its various bodies. NorthMUN hopes to foster the cooperative platform that General Assemblies provide in a way that will allow delegates to examine the many facets of complex global issues and use creative methods to approach and resolve them.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><em>Examples of General Assemblies include the Economic and Financial Committee (</em><strong><em>ECOFIN</em></strong><em>), the Disarmament &amp; International Security Committee (</em><strong><em>DISEC</em></strong><em>) and the Legal Committee (</em><strong><em>Legal</em></strong><em>).</em></p>&nbsp;

<p class="">Specialised Committees, also known as Intermediate Committees, are smaller than General Assemblies/Beginner Committees and consist of more specific agendas. While Beginner Committees such as  WHO focus on broader aspects, Intermediate Committees tend to focus on a more specific aspect of a larger issue. Intermediate committees consist of countries that are heavily involved in the committee’s field, therefore they are selectively chosen and are unique to each committee. For example, there are only 36 members in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and all of them are economic hubs that are actively participating in international trade and development. Since there are many intermediate committees in both the United Nations and other international platforms, every MUN conference tends to include a unique variety of them.</p><p class="">As the name would suggest, specialised committees specialise in a specific environment, Delegates in specialised committees are highly recommended to do research not only on the committee topic but also the committee itself, as oftentimes there are both limitations to a committee’s oversight and budget, as well as extensions to their power in comparison to the larger Beginner Committees.</p><p class=""><em>Examples of Intermediate Committees include the United Nations Environmental Program (</em><strong><em>UNEP</em></strong><em>), the United Nations Human Rights Council (</em><strong><em>UNHRC</em></strong><em>) and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (</em><strong><em>UNODC</em></strong><em>).</em></p><p class="">There are no Intermediate Agencies offered at NorthMUN 2021.</p>&nbsp;<hr />&nbsp;<h3><strong>Regional Councils</strong></h3>

<p class="">Banking on the term ‘regional’, Regional Councils are committees that exist within and cater towards a specific geographical region, often consisting of a union of co-developing nations. These councils create opportunities for their member states to collaborate on projects and to resolve geopolitical issues pertaining primarily to their neighbourhood region. The number of members in a regional council can vary greatly as they depend on the number of member states that exist within a predefined region as well as the said predefinition of the region itself. Historically, regions have been carved in response to subcontinental and international conflict, as well as to mark key economic trade routes. They are also often correlated with societal culture and political ideologies, serving as the basis for either pseudo or externalised military alliances. Regional Councils can often be easily recognised by their name; for example, the European Union (EU) is a regional council consisting of a majority of the countries within the European subcontinent.</p><p class=""><em>Examples of Regional Agencies include the </em>Association of Southeast Asian Nations<em> (</em><strong><em>ASEAN</em></strong><em>), the African Union (</em><strong><em>AU</em></strong><em>), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (</em><strong><em>NATO</em></strong><em>) and the </em><strong><em>Arab League</em></strong><em>.</em></p>&nbsp;

<p class="">Often portrayed as being the most powerful organisations simulated at a conference, as well as being one of the most difficult and cut-throat experiences you’ll have in your MUN career, all Advanced Committees are grounded by at least one commonality: strong, on-the-spot critical thinking is the essence of success. The small size of advanced committees means there’s no way for you to shy away from discussion, and the fast pacing resulting from the nature of such environments means there’s a good chance that you will be put under the spotlight multiple times regardless of your country or position’s political presence.</p><p class="">Many advanced committees will have their own unique twist on RoP. Whether they are in a perpetual crisis scenario, a multi-bloc engagement, an enduring caucus, or any other format, it is important for delegates to be aware of the debate structure. As such, it is recommended that delegates read through the committee’s guidebook for more information on RoP, as well as message the committee dais should they have any further questions or reservations about it.</p><p class="">Advanced committees are recommended for those who are willing to do detailed research about the nuances of a given issue and take a stance on concepts that are less mainstream than other United Nations Committees.&nbsp;At NorthMUN this year, the HCC will be an incredibly competitive committee, with high-stake high-risk topics requiring in-depth research and analysis that isn’t easily found with a single Google search.</p><p class=""><em>Examples of Advanced Committees include the United Nations Security Council (</em><strong><em>UNSC</em></strong><em>), Joint Crisis Committees (</em><strong><em>JCC</em></strong><em>), the International Press Corps (</em><strong><em>IPC</em></strong><em>) and the House of Commons (</em><strong><em>HOC</em></strong><em>).</em></p>&nbsp;
